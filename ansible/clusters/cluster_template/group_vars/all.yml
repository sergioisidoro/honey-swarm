# Variables default values
##
# We recommend to use production values here
# These variables can be overridden later in other group_vars files
#
# Here is the Ansible groups structure:
#  all
#  ├── production
#  ├── staging
#  └── any_other_remote_environment...
#
# Each group has its "_overrides" counterpart, which enables you to override
#  some variables locally in a xxx_overrides.yml file, which is not versionned
# Have a look at .sample.yml files to see some examples
